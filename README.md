# Pygame
Some Pygame samples and derivatives. Samples include:
1. Snake. A clone of the Nokia mobile game.
1. Boids. The classic artificial lifeform that mimmicks the flocking behaviour of birds.
1. Game of Life. A cellular automaton that is still working on its dominion.

## Some admin notes
1. The main class is aptly named with an App as a postfix. For example,
if you want to run Snake, the main class is SnakeApp.
1. I have included the sprites I used. In theory, you should be able to 
export the code, install the missing librarires, and run the App file.
This has not been packaged or tested yet. Sorry.
